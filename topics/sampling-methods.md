# Sampling Methods

## Simple Random Sampling

Each unit of observation has an equal probability of being selected into the sample. The process is selecting a certain number to be in the sample at random.

## Stratified Random Sampling

Ensures you have representation of certain or all groups from the population of interest.

Risks: over-representing a population of interest

Mitigation: assign weights to reflect representation relative to whole population

## Clustered Random Sampling

Sampling people based on naturally occurring clusters (groups, locations).
