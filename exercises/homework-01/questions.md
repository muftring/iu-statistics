|Social status (lower, middle, upper class)| categorical | discrete | ordinal |

## 2. Samples and Population
A sociologist wants to estimate the average age at marriage for women in New England in the early eighteenth century.  She finds within her state archives marriage records for a large Puritan village for the years 1700-1730.  She then takes a sample of those records, noting the age of the bride for each.  The average age in the sample is 24.1 years.  Using a statistical method from Chapter 5, the sociologist estimates the average age of brides at marriage for the population to be between 23.5 and 24.7 years.

- *( a ) What part of this example is descriptive?*<br>
The average age in the sample is 24.1 years.

- *( b ) What part of this example is inferential?*<br>
the sociologist estimates the average age of brides at marriage for the population to be between 23.5 and 24.7 years

- *( c ) To what population does the inference refer?*<br>
married women in New England in the early eighteenth century

## 3. Statistics and Parameters
In the 2014 gubernatorial election in California, a CBS News exit poll of 1824 voters stated that 60.5% voted for the Democratic candidate, Jerry Brown. Of all 7.3 million voters, 60.0% voted for Brown.

- *( a ) What was the population and what was the sample?*<br>
The population was the 7.3 million voters in California.<br>
The sample was 1824 voters in the exit poll.

- *( b ) Identify a statistic and a parameter.*<br>
Statistic: 60.5% of 1824 voters in an exit poll voted for Jerry Brown.<br>
Parameter: 60.0% of all 7.3 million voters voted for Jerry Brown.

## 4. Description and Inference.
The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a monthly survey of households conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. A CPS of 68,000 households in 2013 indicated that of those households, 9.6% of the whites, 27.2% of the blacks, 23.5% of the Hispanics, and 10.5% of the Asians had annual income below the poverty level.

- *( a ) Are these numbers statistics, or parameters? Explain.*<br>
These numbers are statistics because they are derived from a sample of 68,000 of all households in the United States. To find the corresponding actual parameter values, all households in the United States would need to be surveyed.

- *( b ) A method from this text predicts that the percentage of all black households in the United States having income below the poverty level is at least 25% but no greater than 29%. What type of statistical method does this illustrate – descriptive or inferential? Why?*<br>
This is an inferential statistic because it is making a prediction about a population.

## 5. Simple Random Sampling
A local telephone directory has 400 pages with 130 names per page, a total of 52,000 names. Explain how you could choose a simple random sample of five names. Show how to select five random numbers to identify subjects for the sample.

## 6. Observational versus Experimental Studies
A study is planned about whether passive smoking (being exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke on a regular basis) lead to higher rates of lung cancer.

- ( a ) One possible study would take a sample of children, randomly select half of them for placement in an environment where they are passive smokers, place the other half in an environment where they are not exposed to smoke, and then 60 years later observe whether each person has developed lung cancer. Would this study be experimental or observational? Why?

- ( b) For many reasons, including time and ethics, it is not possible to conduct the study in (a). Describe a way that is possible, and indicate whether it would be an experimental, or observational, study.

## 7. Sampling Bias
Explain how the following had sampling bias, and explain what it means to call their samples “volunteer samples.”

- ( a ) The BBC in Britain requested viewers to call the network and indicate their favorite poem. Of more than 7500 callers, more than twice as many voted for Rudyard Kipling’s “If” than for any other poem. The BBC reported that this was the clear favorite.

- ( b ) A mail-in questionnaire published in TV Guide posed the question “Should the President have the Lin Item Veto to eliminate waste?” Of those who responded, 97% said yes. For the same question posed to a random sample, 71% said yes.

## 8. Cluster Sampling
Refer to Problem \#5 about selecting 5 of 52,000 names on 400 pages of a directory.

- ( a ) Select five numbers to identify subjects for a systematic random sample of five names from the directory.

- ( b ) Is cluster sampling applicable? How could it be carried out, and what would be the advantages and disadvantages?

## 9. Stratified Sampling
With a total sample size of 100, we want to compare Native Americans to other Americans on the percentage favoring legalized gambling. Why might it be useful to take a disproportional stratified random sample?
