This assignment should be completed by Saturday 5/26/2018 before 11:59 PM EST.

Identify a newspaper article that reports on the statistical results of a study. Post on this discussion thread and provide the title of the article (with a link) and a short excerpt. Then answer the following questions regarding the study (you likely have to find the study):

1. What was the main goal of the study?
2. Who were the subjects in the study?
3. How were the study subjects sampled?
4. What was the response measured on the study subjects?
5. Are there any discrepancies between the newspaper article report on the study and the study itself (assuming you could find the study)?

After you post, read through your classmatesâ€™ responses to see the array of studies and sampling methods reported on in the news.
