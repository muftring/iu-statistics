Identify a newspaper article that reports on the statistical results of a study. Post on this discussion thread and provide the title of the article (with a link) and a short excerpt. Then answer the following questions regarding the study (you likely have to find the study):

1. What was the main goal of the study?
2. Who were the subjects in the study?
3. How were the study subjects sampled?
4. What was the response measured on the study subjects?
5. Are there any discrepancies between the newspaper article report on the study and the study itself (assuming you could find the study)?

After you post, read through your classmatesâ€™ responses to see the array of studies and sampling methods reported on in the news.

[Study links diet soda to higher risk of stroke, dementia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/04/21/study-links-diet-soda-to-higher-risk-of-stroke-dementia/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.d9ea809ffd38)

# Study
[Sugar- and Artificially Sweetened Beverages and the Risks of Incident Stroke and Dementia](http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/early/2017/04/20/STROKEAHA.116.016027)


The article's main discussion point is: "a new study shows an association between diet soda and both stroke and dementia, with people drinking diet soda daily being almost three times as likely to develop stroke and dementia as those who consumed it weekly or less."

# Discussion

## What was the main goal of the study?
The main goal of this study was to determine if there is a link between consumption of artificially sweetened beverages and incidences of stroke and dementia.

## Who were the subjects in the study?
The subjects for this study were participants in the Framingham Heart Study.

## How were the study subjects sampled?
The subjects were selected from the total population (of the Framingham Heart Study) based on age and any prevalent conditions associated with each part of the study. For the assessment of stroke risk, the age cutoff was >45 years, and for dementia the age cutoff was >60 years.

## What was the response measured on the study subjects?
This was an observational study which relied on subjects reporting their consumption rates for naturally and artificially sweetened beverages (reported as number per day).

## Are there any discrepancies between the newspaper article report on the study and the study itself (assuming you could find the study)?
No. The article and the study are both very clear that this was an observational study. Due to this nature of study, the general positioning is that the study is representing a hypothesis but still trying to present the results as a profound conclusion.
