    "## Controlling for Other Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental component of evaluating whether X causes Y involves ruling out alternative explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this by studying whether the relationship between X and Y persists after removing the influence of other variables on this association. In other words, we **control** for the variables that offer an alternative explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experimental control**: the ability to keep a variable at a fixed value, e.g. temperature or atmospheric pressure in a chemistry or physics experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical control**: grouping sample results based on the value (or value range) of respondents, e.g. education level (less than high school degree, high school degree, some college, completed 2-year or 4-year degree, etc.) or income.\n",

    "Be wary of **lurking variables**: a variable that is not measured in a study but influences the association of interest."

    "\n",
    "### Spurious Relationships\n",
    "An association between $X_{1}$ and $Y$ is said to be a **spurious relationship** if both are dependent on a third variable $X_{2}$, and their association disappears when $X_{2}$ is controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chain Relationships\n",
    "In **chain relationships**, the main independent variable of interest $X_{1}$ is only a distal cause of the outcome $Y$ with $X_{2}$ being an intervening variable, which is itself caused by $X_{1}$. $X_{2}$ is then hypothesized to cause $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple Causes\n",
    "This occurs if a certain outcome $Y$ has multiple causes $X_{1}$ abd $X_{2}$ simultaneously. These causes may be independent of each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if $X_{1}$ = *gender*, and $X_{2}$ = *race*, both have effects on delinquency such that delinquency rates vary both according to gender and race, then $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ are likely to be independent causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suppressor Variables\n",
    "Occasionaly two variables show no association until a third variable is controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Interaction\n",
    "**Statistical interaction** exists between $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ in their effects on $Y$ when the true effect of one predictor on $Y$ chnages as the value of the other predictor changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To asses whether a sample shows evidence of interaction, we can compare the effect of $X_{1}$ on $Y$ at different levels of $X_{2}$. When the sample effect is different at each level of $X_{2}$, there is evidence of interaction of $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ in their effect on $Y$."
