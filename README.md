IU Statistical Analysis for Effective Decision Making (Summer, 2018)

# Introduction
The purpose of statistics is to make sense of the world using information or data.

# Data
Tabular format:
- **rows** are observations, or records
- **columns** are variables, or fields

# Data Sources

## Primary Data Collection
generally collected ourselves
- surveys
- experiments
- direct observation

## Secondary Data Collection
obtain a data set that has already been collected by a third party
- public use data sets (e.g., Census data)
- administrative data sets
  - from an agency: government, non profit, public or private agency
  - usually related to and collected by the agency

# Unit of Analysis
- data collected at the *individual* level; a single record per individual
- survey of household, and every record would be for a single household
- average measures of cities
- units of aggregation: e.g., school level, firm level, country level

> the important thing when thinking about data and doing analysis with data, you want the unit of analysis in the data sets to be consistent

# What is Statistics?
Statistics consists of a body of methods for obtaining and analyzing data.

Statistics provides methods for:
- **Design**: planning how to gather data for research studies
- **Description**: summarizing the data
- **Inference**: making predictions based on the data

# Statistical Analysis: Key Terms
- **Population**: total set of subject of interest in a study
- **Sample**: subset of the Population on which the study collects data
- **Descriptive Statistics**: summarize the data using graphs, tables and numbers
- **Inferential Statistics**: use data to make predictions about a Population, using sample data
- **Parameter**: a numerical summary of the Population
- **Statistic**: a numerical summary of the sample data
