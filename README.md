IU Statistical Analysis for Effective Decision Making (Summer, 2018)

# Introduction
The purpose of statistics is to make sense of the world using information or data.

# Data
Tabular format:
- **rows** are observations, or records
- **columns** are variables, or fields

# Data Sources

## Primary Data Collection
generally collected ourselves
- surveys
- experiments
- direct observation

## Secondary Data Collection
obtain a data set that has already been collected by a third party
- public use data sets (e.g., Census data)
- administrative data sets
  - from an agency: government, non profit, public or private agency
  - usually related to and collected by the agency

# Unit of Analysis
- data collected at the *individual* level; a single record per individual
- survey of household, and every record would be for a single household
- average measures of cities
- units of aggregation: e.g., school level, firm level, country level

> the important thing when thinking about data and doing analysis with data, you want the unit of analysis in the data sets to be consistent

# What is Statistics?
Statistics consists of a body of methods for obtaining and analyzing data.

Statistics provides methods for:
- **Design**: planning how to gather data for research studies
- **Description**: summarizing the data
- **Inference**: making predictions based on the data

# Statistical Analysis: Key Terms
- **Population**: total set of subject of interest in a study
- **Sample**: subset of the Population on which the study collects data
- **Descriptive Statistics**: summarize the data using graphs, tables and numbers
- **Inferential Statistics**: use data to make predictions about a Population, using sample data
- **Parameter**: a numerical summary of the Population
- **Statistic**: a numerical summary of the sample data

# Sampling and Measurement

## Variables and Measurement
A **variable** is a *characteristic* that can vary in value among subjects in a sample or population. A variation in observations across a data set.

The values that a variable can take on are called the **measurement scale**. (e.g., Age: 0-100, Gender: M | F, Political Party Affiliation: Democrat | Republican | Independent | other,...)

**Quantitative**: measurement scale is numeric
- measured on an **interval scale** (there is an equal distance between each level)

**Qualitative** (or **Categorical**): measurement scale is a set of categories
- non-ordered categorical variable: a categorical variable for which there is no natural inherent ranking or ordering
- measured on a *nominal* or *ordinal* scale
- **nominal scale**: no implicit ranking (e.g., ice cream flavors)
- **ordinal scale**: implicit ranking (e.g., social class)

**Discrete variables** may take values that form a set of separate numbers, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

**Continuous variables** may take values along the infinite continuum of possible real number values.

> The statistical method used to analyze data depends on whether the variable is quantitative vs. categorical, or discrete vs. continuous
